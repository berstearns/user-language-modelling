Instead of a letter taking days or weeks to arrive, emails arrive almost immediately. I also like using it for finding out about many things. So, if I want to find out more about an actor I like, for example, I can google his or her name and check what movies he has been in. Its the same with film directors: I can find out what other films they have made. I can use the internet to upload my photos on facebook and share my adventures with friends and family: it is a way of feeling close even though we are far apart.\\n    '},\n",

Direct sex discrimination is when an employer treats a woman less favorably than a man. Is Just? Indirect discrimination applies to policies and practices that, in reality, favor one gender considerably more than another - although, on the surface, they seem to apply to both sexes equally. You believe is just? Unlawful harassment is when an individual is subjected to unwanted conduct relating to their gender, when someone engages in unwanted verbal, non verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature, and/or when someone treats the woman less favorably because she rejected the unwanted conduct.

       "   'text': \"\\n      Claude Monet : He painted 'The Road Bridge at Argenteuil' in 1874. It was painted on site and shows the boats on the River Seine. A characteristic of Impressionism is the use of the complementary colors blue-orange and green-red,as seen in this painting. Monet applied soft small strokes of different tints and shades to create the quiet movement of the water. Monet and other Impressionists wanted to capture the effects of light and atmosphere and convey their sensory experience. This was done by applying thin colors over a thicker layer of underpainting as shown in the sky. Exhibit ends on 3 January. Franz Marc: ' The Blue Rider' was painted by Franz Marc. He devoted much of his career to painting horses and other animals. His compositions were radical and he experimented boldly with color to express the primitive energy of animals. This movement ended with the outbreak of WW1. Cubist Wing: Opens 1 October and it runs through to 31 March. Part of the permanent collection. George Braque: He painted 'Le Jour' in 1929. Its a still life done in muted greens, grays, ochers and browns. Various objects such as a jar, a knife, a violin and an open drawer are shown fragmented, as if seen from multiple viewpoints. The items are fragmented, but on the other hand, the composition is well-balanced. There is to be a special event highlighting some previously unknown cubist works of art on opening day, 1 October.\\n    \"},\n",

I strongly believe that the overall social and economic costs of big-box retail are too high. It is said that big-box stores provide local employment opportunities. On the other hand, big-box stores are guilty of substandard labor practices. A recent survey has shown that property values and community tax base will reduce if more big-box stores are built in the area. Furthermore, pollution will increase as more people will be driving to the big-box stores. And how about the night time light glare? All in all, I see no benefit to our community if more big-box stores are allowed to open, and I wanted to make my opinion known. Yours sincerely...\\n    '},\n",

Judith Handley who has lived in Hanbury for over 15 years said, Its absolutely outrageous. I cant believe they are going to build a factory right next door to where our kids play every day. Im still struggling to believe that the council approved it. Ms Handley and other residents are thinking of putting together an appeal to present to the council. The council members have got to listen, she added. I bet they wouldnt like it on their doorstep. I really worry that people will stop using the recreation ground and then the area will definitely lose some of its community spirit. Meanwhile, the full environmental impact of the factory remains uncertain. Josh Grahams is an environmentalist and he told us this, cosmetic factories are not generally high polluters, but theres no way of knowing its full impact until its built and by then itll be too late.\\n    '},\n",

       "   'text': '\\n      If you prefer security and consistent repayments over a certain period, then a fixed loan may be the most suited to you. Negotiating a fixed-rate home loan enables you to make consistent repayments with the same interest rates over a set period of time. If you want to make additional repayments, then a variable rate could be more appropriate. By having the right mix of features, flexibility, interest rates and fees, the standard variable-rate home loan is the most commonly used. This type of loan, which is mainly suitable for making extra repayments without penalty, also allows you to split your loan or access a line of credit. If you have surplus disposable income, then a 100 per cent offset account could be the answer. Unlike an all-in-one loan, where funds are withdrawn from both your credit card and your transaction accounts to pay off the loan, an offset account is just like having a savings account which is linked to your loan account. Over time, the loan is reduced by savings in your offset account, allowing you to pay off your loan more quickly.\\n    '},\n",
